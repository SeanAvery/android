Alright guys here is the ListView lesson and some additional resources for those that want to review/tackle some other topics

An app idea that you can make with what we have covered in class (it can be pretty challenging) is a Calculator app. If you want to do more android stuff on your own I recommend it.

Here are some tutorial videos on ListViews that I'd recommend. The first one talks a little about how it works, and the 2nd one is when he gets into the code. If you're short on time you could only watch the 2nd one. 

The 2nd video also touches on how to make ListView items clickable by setting a listener in Java. For those that want to extend this workshop project, add the ability to delete list items by clicking on them!
